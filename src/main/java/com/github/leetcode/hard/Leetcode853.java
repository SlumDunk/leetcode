 * @Description: There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].
 * <p>
 * Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
 * <p>
 * Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
 * Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
 * Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
 * Output: 105.00000
 * Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
 * Output: 30.66667
 * Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= K <= N <= 10000, where N = quality.length = wage.length
 * 1 <= quality[i] <= 10000
 * 1 <= wage[i] <= 10000
 * Answers within 10^-5 of the correct answer will be considered correct.
