/**
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
 * strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * 
 * Note: The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit
 * signed integer. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
 * representation. 
 * Example 1: Input: 5 Output: 2 Explanation: The binary
 * representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010.
 * So you need to output 2. 
 * Example 2: Input: 1 Output: 0 Explanation: The
 * binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is
 * 0. So you need to output 0.
