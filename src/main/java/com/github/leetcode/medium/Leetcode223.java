 * @Description: Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.
 * <p>
 * Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.
 * <p>
 * Rectangle Area
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
 * Output: 45
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.
