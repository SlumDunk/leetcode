 * @Description: Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.
 * <p>
 * Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.
 * <p>
 * The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * The graph looks like this:
 * 0----1
 * |    |
 * |    |
 * 3----2
 * We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 * The graph looks like this:
 * 0----1
 * | \  |
 * |  \ |
 * 3----2
 * We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * graph will have length in range [1, 100].
 * graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
 * graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
 * The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].
