 * @Description: Given a binary tree
 * <p>
 * struct TreeLinkNode {
 * TreeLinkNode *left;
 * TreeLinkNode *right;
 * TreeLinkNode *next;
 * }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * <p>
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
 * You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Given the following perfect binary tree,
 * <p>
 * 1
 * /  \
 * 2    3
 * / \  / \
 * 4  5  6  7
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 * <p>
 * 1 -> NULL
 * /  \
 * 2 -> 3 -> NULL
 * / \  / \
 * 4->5->6->7 -> NULL
